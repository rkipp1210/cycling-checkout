JGR Cycling Checkout System
================

###Checkout system for lunch bike rides.  

This app will someday be placed by the door so we know who is still out riding, so we don't lock them out, and if there's a problem, we can know that too.

This is a change to commit

To run the app:
```bash
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```
